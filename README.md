School data analysis 

This report analyzes math and reading scores for 15 different high schools based on school size, type, and budget. First, a total school summary was created, followed by an analysis of math and reading scores. Next, the data was stratified by grade, school type, size, and budget, and once again, math and reading scores as well as percentage of students who passed both were looked at in order to uncover possible interactions between these variables. 

One interesting conclusion uncovered by this analysis, was the finding that counterintuitervely, district spending per student is inversely correlated to the total percentage of students passing math and reading both on individual scores and overall; meaning, schools with smaller budgets per student had higher rates of students passing as compared to those with higher budgets. Another finding showed that while small (<1000) and medium (1000-2000) sized schools had comparable student passing rates, those for large (2000-5000) sized schools seemed slightly lower. Charter schools showed significantly better outcomes for reading scores, math scores, and overall passing rate. There seemed to be no significant differences between math and reading scores for grades 9-12 when stratified by school. Further analysis should be done to check if any of these variables are confounded with one another.
